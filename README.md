Part 2 : Glossary 

**Branch** : A branch is a line of development. Each branch has a different version of the project code. Branches can be merged once development on a feature has been finished.
**Clone** : A clone is an exact copy of a repository.
**Commit** : Updating a branch with new code changes. When files in a project are updated, and these files are sent to the branch, this is called a commit.
**Fetch** : This gets the head reference of a branch, to find out which files are missing from the local machine, and gets them.
**GIT** : An open source version control system. Git tracks different files, the changes made to those files, who made these changes, and when they made the changes.
**Github** : Internet hosting service for version control using git. When git is linked with a github account, commits and pushes are uploaded to github servers and can be viewed from a browser, online.
**Merge** : Combining two branches together into one.
**Merge Conflict** : When a merge cannot be completed due to competing commits. This often happens when multiple people modify the same line of a file, or when one person deletes a file, while another modifies it. Conflicts must be resolved before a merge can take place.
**Push** : Push gets the head reference of a remote branch, and compares it to the local branch. If remote is an ancestor (older than) to local, push will send all the local files into the remote repository
**Pull** :Pull brings the contents of a remote branch into the local one. Pull consists of a fetch, and a merge.
**Remote** : Something that is stored somewhere else, on a different computer, often GitHub servers.
**Repository** : A collection of references, and an object database. In practice, contains all files that are part of the given project.
